    </u>
    <p>Cows are the animals which provide milk. Milk has calcium which is very important for the growth of a human body. And children from a very small age start drinking cow milk, and even elders consume milk in different forms such as tea or coffee.</p>

    <p>Without milk, there would be no dairies. And so the milk that comes from cows are used in dairies to earn money and also to make confectionary products such as cake and chocolates. Milk is also used in the production of important everyday eatables such as Ghee, Butter, Lassi, Paneer, and other items that can only be made with milk.</p>

    </u>
    <p>Cows are considered to be herbivorous. Even though they can eat Indian bread of wheat, they are still herbivorous. For many years, just by eating different plants and grasses, cows have developed and adapted to eating plantations only. They don’t eat any kind of meat.</p>

    </u></h3>
    <p>A cow is a very passive animal. It will never attack anyone. But cows are also very protective of their children; if they sense any sort of danger coming towards their children, regardless of whomsoever it may be, they will use their horns to attack. In general, you can go and pet them; they won’t be bothered. You can even take something with you for them to eat such as a Roti and they will be happy. Indians and Cows. 'Indians worship cows' it is an animal which is considered as holy according to the Indian traditions. Cows are banned to be killed in India unlike other countries and use their meat which is called beef for eating purposes and business purposes. It is the rule of the Supreme.

                <h3>Cow Dung and its uses</h3>
            </u>
            <p>Cows should be respected as they provide a lot of value to human lives. The cow dung is used as manure. When it gets dry, it becomes an excellent source of energy, and it comes under renewable sources of energy which is an added bonus. It can be used as a source to provide heat by putting fire on it, and also as a flame for cooking food. Also, a mixture of mud and cow dung is used in most of the rural parts of India by applying to into the floors, walls, and rooftop to form a waterproof layer to insulate the house from loss of heat or entry of it and also it doesn’t smell unpleasant. Due to the presence of high fiber in cow dung, it is also used to make papers. The paper is good enough to be used commercially. There are a lot more advantages of using cow dung.</p>

                <h3>Other ways cows help in</h3>
            </u>
            <p>Cows help in transportation too. They are tied to the carts, and then they pull it taking the cart forward along with them. This kind of transportation is still used by people living in rural India. Also, cows eat all the useless grass and the weeds from the grass fields, which is again useful to the human beings as they now don’t have to go through the hefty procedure of cutting and removing all the unnecessary grass and weeds which saves a lot of time and energy to do other productive things. Cows help in agriculture in a big way in every part of India where farming is done. Cows help in fertilizing the soil by working on the fields every day. Their urine also acts as a very effective pesticide, and their dung has antibacterial qualities which are used to protect walls and homes in villages.</p>

                <h3>After death also useful</h3>
            </u>
            <p>Even after they die, their skin and bones are used to make money. Meat is forbidden to be consumed in India that is why it is left to be used. But the skin is used for manufacturing leather items, and the carcass of the bones is sold in the markets. It is a very big money market. Though it is a crime to kill a cow and then use it for money making purposes, but it seems like it is okay to use an already dead cow to make money. But it is done very discreetly, as there are people who will get really offended by such activities and also the Supreme Court is against such activities.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            </u>
            <p>It can be concluded that without cows, there will be an economic deficiency and people will lack the source for dairy and confectionary items which are used on a daily basis. Cows help in making Biogas, and both its dung and urine is very useful in terms of productivity. Without cows, it would be hard to grow crops in the agriculture sector. And also cows are considered to be a holy animal in India and are often worshipped while praying to gods. They eat all unnecessary plantations saving the time of humans to do other productive things at the same time. Cows are called as ‘Gau Mata’ in India. And so cows are really useful animals, and therefore they should be respected in every way for all their necessary help with day to day life of humans. They should not be hurt or mistreated in any way, and if someone does that, they should be reported to the police right away as it is a punishable offense in India. Cows are really sweet animals and love the people who provide them with food and shelter. They are grateful animals who don't harm anything.</p>
