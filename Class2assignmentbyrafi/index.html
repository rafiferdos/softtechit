    <p>Without milk, there would be no dairies. And so the milk that comes from cows are used in dairies to earn money and also to make confectionary products such as cake and chocolates. Milk is also used in the production of important everyday eatables such as Ghee, Butter, Lassi, Paneer, and other items that can only be made with milk.</p>

    <p>Cows are considered to be herbivorous. Even though they can eat Indian bread of wheat, they are still herbivorous. For many years, just by eating different plants and grasses, cows have developed and adapted to eating plantations only. They don’t eat any kind of meat.</p>

    <p>A cow is a very passive animal. It will never attack anyone. But cows are also very protective of their children; if they sense any sort of danger coming towards their children, regardless of whomsoever it may be, they will use their horns to attack. In general, you can go and pet them; they won’t be bothered. You can even take something with you for them to eat such as a Roti and they will be happy. Indians and Cows. 'Indians worship cows' it is an animal which is considered as holy according to the Indian traditions. Cows are banned to be killed in India unlike other countries and use their meat which is called beef for eating purposes and business purposes. It is the rule of the Supreme. Court to not harm any cows. We Indians get very sentimental when it comes to cows and the decisions that affect them. Cows are often referred to as ‘Gau Mata’ in India.<p>

            <p>Even after they die, their skin and bones are used to make money. Meat is forbidden to be consumed in India that is why it is left to be used. But the skin is used for manufacturing leather items, and the carcass of the bones is sold in the markets. It is a very big money market. Though it is a crime to kill a cow and then use it for money making purposes, but it seems like it is okay to use an already dead cow to make money. But it is done very discreetly, as there are people who will get really offended by such activities and also the Supreme Court is against such activities.</p>

                <p>Here it is</p>
            </a>
            <p>It can be concluded that without cows, there will be an economic deficiency and people will lack the source for dairy and confectionary items which are used on a daily basis. Cows help in making Biogas, and both its dung and urine is very useful in terms of productivity. Without cows, it would be hard to grow crops in the agriculture sector. And also cows are considered to be a holy animal in India and are often worshipped while praying to gods. They eat all unnecessary plantations saving the time of humans to do other productive things at the same time. Cows are called as ‘Gau Mata’ in India. And so cows are really useful animals, and therefore they should be respected in every way for all their necessary help with day to day life of humans. They should not be hurt or mistreated in any way, and if someone does that, they should be reported to the police right away as it is a punishable offense in India. Cows are really sweet animals and love the people who provide them with food and shelter. They are grateful animals who don't harm anything.</p>
